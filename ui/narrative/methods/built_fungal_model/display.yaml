parameters :
    genome_ref :
        ui-name : |
            Genome Name
        short-hint : |
            Select the Genome from which to construct the model.
    template_model :
        ui-name : |
            Template Type
        short-hint : |
            TSelect either the default template (consolidates all published fungal models listed) or an individual model as the template.
    gapfill_model :
        ui-name : |
            Gapfill the Model
        short-hint : |
            Gapfill the model in complete media (an arbitrary media where the model could uptake any nutrient that it has a transporter for).
    translation_policy :
        ui-name : |
            Translation Policy
        short-hint : |
            Choose either "translation only" where the starting model will be translated based on the proteome comparison data generated against the selected template or "add unique genes" where reactions associated with any unique genes will be added.
    custom_model :
        ui-name : |
            Custom Model
        short-hint : |
            Select a custom model as the template for model propagation. Two requirements need to be met in order to use a custom template: (i) the name of the custom template must be given and (ii) the "Custom Template" option from the dropdown under "Template Type" must be chosen.
    proteintr_ref :
        ui-name : |
            Proteome Comparison
        short-hint : |
            Use an existing proteome comparison to build a model, keep it blank to generate a new proteome comparison.
    output_model :
        ui-name : |
            Output Model
        short-hint : |
            The name for the newly constructed model.

    <p>This App allows users to construct models for fungal genomes through model propagation. It constructs genome-scale fungal models using a curated set of reactions derived from 14 published fungal metabolic models (listed under the “Template type” field). As the basis for the method, we produced a consolidated default template model that encompasses the biochemistry data from the published fungal models and the structural annotations from the associated fungal genomes.</p>
    <p>Update: Beta version by default produce a model based on genome 'Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_5288c (GCF_000146045.2)' linked to the published model iMM904.</p>
    <p>This approach involves:
      <ol>
        <li>Computing a set of orthologous proteins (a ProteomeComparison object) based on the input Genome's structural annotations and the fungal template.</li>
        <li>Ascertaining the specific biochemical reactions that represent the metabolism of the input Genome via the orthologous proteins.</li>
        <li>Propagating the related biochemistry data from the curated fungal template to construct a draft metabolic model.</li>
        <li>Gapfilling the draft metabolic model based on complete media (if the "Gapfil the model" option is checked).</li>
        <li>Adding additional reactions based on available functional annotations.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>The draft model that is constructed can be applied to any downstream model analysis App in KBase that takes a metabolic model as an input.</p>

    <p>Please see the Metabolic Modeling section of the App catalog for possible subsequent steps in the metabolic modeling process.
